    <h1>About</h1>

     <p>Day Repeat Day is an interactive story and a match-3 game that takes you through the years in a life of an average person. You're hired to do a job. You try to manage your relationships. But you're never really sure where it's all leading to. It's a story about living, the daily grind and what it all means in the end, topped with a sprinkle of satire and mysteries.</p>

  <p>After doing a lot of action games, I wanted to do something much more intimate and personal and Day Repeat Day is what came of it. I hope you find it a meaningful experience!</p>
